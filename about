My fascination with speech science started when I was still immersed in a musical research and performing arts environment. Combining these two fields, my research today focusses on common mechanisms underlying coordination of articulatory movements in speech and general movement control. The behavior of articulators resembles that found in other movement related fields, such as music production or walking. This means that similar (cognitive and mechanical) constraints in related fields, such as music, dance, rhythm etc. are expected when explaining underlying variability in speech.

Two main questions drive my research:
How do cognitive, (bio)-mechanical constraints, and their interactions affect the final articulatory movements in speech production?
Which patterns of articulatory movements are universal and what is specifically related to the speech production system?

One current line of my research focusses on how patterns of articulatory coordination are driven by rhythmic repetitive behavior. To unraffle specific articulatory constraints and general movement control, I investigate differences and similarities observed in finger tapping and articulatory movements.

A second line of study, to answer the questions related to control and coordination of movements, focusses on what happens when the speech production system breaks down and individuals show dysarthric speech, such as in Parkinson's disease, ALS and individuals with cerebellar lesions.
