## Projects and research interests

**Metronome and its effect on fluency in adults who stutter and individuals with Parkinson's Disease**

**Cerebellar Ataxia**

**Using  spectral features to distinguish speakers with different types of dysarthria from neurobiologically healthy speakers**​

One of the factors that is affected in Parkinson’s disease is intelligible speech production. In most cases, Patients develop hypokinetic dysarthria, and the onset and development of this speech motor disorder is frequently difficult to assess and determine perceptually by clinicians. Our study provided an acoustic tool that separated typical speakers from mild and moderate dysarthric speakers with Parkinson’s disease and ALS.

**Complexity of Rhythmic Tapping and Stuttering**​

In this project, we examined a possible link between articulatory and general motor behavior in people who stutter. Differences in motor behavior in PWS are not limited to speech but can also be found in other motor tasks. One of the theories is that stutterers face difficulty with the timing of motor events in general. We asked ourselves whether PWS can fill in the time between metronome beats with extra taps, a skill necessary in speech that is characterized by less predictable rhythms.  
In addition to synchronizing with and continuing a series of metronome beats, we examined if PWS have difficulties with estimating time between external metronome beats by letting them fill in the time with several taps.  The data showed that people who stutter indeed differed in tapping behavior and this finding is laying the groundwork for our larger study which is in progress as we speak.

**Articulation techniques in clarinet playing**​

Just like speech production, articulation of notes while playing a woodwind or brass instrument involves movements of the tongue and lips. I collaborated with the renowned clarinet player Kornel Wolak and we investigate what the tongue does when players articulate notes on the clarinet: https://kornelwolak.com/ 

**Speech errors**
